                <ol type="a">
                    <li>The materials on {{ config('app.name') }}'s website are provided on an 'as is' basis.
                        {{ config('app.name') }} makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and
                        negates all
                        other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
                        merchantability, fitness
                        for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of
                        rights.</li>
                    <li>Further, {{ config('app.name') }} does not warrant or make any representations concerning the

                        likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating

                </ol>
                <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
                <p>In no event shall {{ config('app.name') }} or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including,
                    without
                    limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the
                    use or
                    inability to use the materials on {{ config('app.name') }}'s website, even if
                    {{ config('app.name') }} or a
                    {{ config('app.name') }} authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
                    possibility of
                    such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or
                    limitations of
                    liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
